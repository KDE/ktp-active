Welcome to KDE Telepathy Active

Instalation:

mkdir build 
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=`kde4-config --prefix` ..
make
sudo make install


Note: 
Im using kdeclarativeview and kdeclarativemainwindow borrowed from
Plasma Active from 
https://projects.kde.org/projects/extragear/base/plasma-mobile/repository/revisions/master/show/applications/common

I added it to the root directory so if you dont have plasma active you might 
want to uncommenct #add_subdirectory(common) from root's folder CMakeLists.txt
in order to build it.
